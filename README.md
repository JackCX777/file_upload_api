provides an API with the following functionality:

or username/password pair
- upload and process an excel file
- retrieve the date and time the file was uploaded
- retrieve the processing status (uploaded, processing, finished)
- retrieve the processing result
- retrieve the date and time of the end of processing, 
if the processing is completed



The following technologies are used to implement the service:
